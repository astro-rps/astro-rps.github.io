All research carried in these scientific fields requires the use of extensive programming, making it a bedrock skill of any scientist. In this seminar, we will start from square one, covering how to install and navigate the programming ecosystem such as the terminal/shell, before moving into how to create scientific programs in python to carry out calculations one might use in a research project. This seminar is primarily intended for students with little to no exposure to coding or astronomy research. After taking this seminar, students should be prepared to tackle programming-based courses (e.g., ASTR 255/330) as well as feel comfortable applying to summer research positions.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"Fp7mo1rrNg"}],"key":"ZVkP9JG2cV"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This seminar is pass/no pass, and meets twice a week in the afternoon (M/W 5-6). Monday sessions will have (interactive) lectures in which a new programming concept is introduced. Wednesday is a “lab” in which students will work on a weekly assignment targeting those concepts. We expect most students to finish the weekly assignment during the Wednesday session, but they are due the following Tuesday, so time can be taken outside of the seminar if needed. These assignments and general participation make up most (70%) of the final grade; the rest is in a final project in which students can form partnerships/groups, and pick any topic (astronomy or otherwise) for which to code a larger scale program which is presented in class.","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"m2JsEnsTHb"}],"key":"vHC3QP3Yky"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"More details about the exact topics and schedule will be available soon.","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"key":"k5qbQcPBgQ"}],"key":"Z1kbekifCG"}],"key":"gHZdOhfHjB"}],"key":"YHVpFYtAIP"},"references":{"cite":{"order":[],"data":{}}},"footer":{"navigation":{"next":{"title":"Welcome to the Astro Research Preparation Series!","url":"/intro","group":"Week  1"}}},"domain":"http://localhost:3000"}
