    "The *Gaia* satellite has collected stellar positions, motions, and brightnesses for nearly two billion stars in the Milky Way. The file \"GaiaM92.csv\" contains example data from *Gaia* specifically for the globular star cluster Messier 92 (M92). To investigate the data, take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the .csv file into a dataframe called m92_data. Each row in this datafile is an individual star.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Plot a histogram of the column \"phot_g_mean_mag\". This is the column that contains the brightnesses of stars.  What do you notice about the distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now, make a scatterplot with the column \"bp_rp\" (a proxy for color) on the x-axis and \"phot_g_mean_mag\" (a proxy for luminosity) on the y-axis. Is the distribution in this plane uniform, or do you see patterns/sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Clean up the scatterplot from part 3: first, invert the y-axis so smaller numbers are at the top of the plot, and limit the x range to -0.5 to 2.  Then, change the marker size and color to be small, black points. Lastly, label both axes something physically meaningful (not just the column names)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Compare your diagram to the one shown at this link: [Cluster HR Diagram](https://www.mps.mpg.de/5484970/original-1534168518.png?t=eyJ3aWR0aCI6ODAwLCJoZWlnaHQiOjYwMCwib2JqX2lkIjo1NDg0OTcwfQ==--5f4cb09228b20d5b3a71fbd40fa5a346ee619316). Can you observe the same features in your plot?\n"

    "\n",
    "The **horizontal branch** of the HR diagram (see Q5 of Exercise 1) is comprised of stars at roughly the same luminosity regardless of temperature. Since we have a sense of the instrinsic (absolute) luminosity of these stars, we can compared that to their observed luminosity to get a sense of their distance. For a globular cluster like M92, we can then average over the distance to these special stars to get a distance to the cluster. In this exercise, we'll do exactly that!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, isolate the horizontal branch by filtering based on the phot_g_mean_mag column and the bp_rp column. In practice, you need four selections total which select for stars in this feature (e.g, mag > 15 and mag < 16 and similar for bp_rp). I recommend you impose phot_g_mean_mag < 15.5 as one of them to get the best possible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The \"absolute\" G-band luminosity of stars on the horizontal branch is G = 0.3. Create a new column called \"DistanceModulus\" which is phot_g_mean_mag minus this number.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The distance modulus (unitless) is related to the distance (in kiloparsecs) via the formula \n",

This galaxy is drowned out by foreground stars from the Milky Way disk, which we can cleverly remove using the information from Gaia.\n",

Parallaxes are related to distances via distance (in pc) = 1/parallax, and so removing stars with large parallax with leave us with a sample of only the more distant stars. Store the output in a new dataframe called filtered_stars.\n",

Then, come up with a rectangular selection based on the pmra/pmdec columns that could be used to select for rows consistent with this signal (e.g.. pmra > -5).\n",
