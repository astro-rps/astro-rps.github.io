Your tasks will involve reading the data, analyzing it, and using `numpy`, logic, and loops to answer questions about it! "

    "Recall from Week 0, you need to update the PATH to match where the data lives on your computer! You can put the data anywhere on your computer, and specify the absolute PATH in your code like the example I have above. Alternately, if you put the data in the **same directory** (folder) as the python script you are writing, you can open it like this: `np.load(messier_data.npy)`.  \n",

    "- **RA** and **DEC**: the Right Ascension and Declination of the object (coordinates in the sky). \n",
    "- **Type**: Type of object (e.g., `'Gc'` for Globular Cluster, `'Sp'` for Spiral, `'Ba'` for Barred Spiral)\n",
    "- **Mag**: Magnitude (brightness) of the object. Magnitudes are a unit-less system, and lower numbers mean brighter objects! \n",
    "- **Distance**: Distance from Earth in units of light-years\n",
    "- **Constellation**: The constellation in which the object resides\n",

    "1) You can access each row of the dataset using **indexing**. For instance, `data[0]` will return the first row of the array (aka all of the above column values for a single Messier object).\n",
    "2) You can access each column of the dataset using `data['Messier']` for example, where now rather than indexing by an integer we are indexing by a column **key** (a column name). This will return a numpy array of all the Messier numbers for all of the objects. "

    "You can do this (at least) two ways! First, try using a **condition** to **index** the array. Your condition would be something that is checking the object types, and you can use that condition directly as the index to select only rows in the array where that condition is `True`. I think we have not technically gone over this yet, but see if you can try it out! Once you have the subset of the array that meets your condition, you can compute the average how we covered in lecture (as in exercise 1 problem 2).  \n",

    "Another way you could approach this problem (which you should be able to do with what we've covered in lecture) is by using a `for` loop to iterate over every row, and then using `if` statements to select based on type. How would you compute the average? Try to think creatively about how you can perform math on values (recall exercise 1 problem 3) iteratively in a loop. Maybe you will need to define two variables that you operate on each iteration of the loop, then do something to the two variables at the end after the loop finishes.... \n",

    "You can try using a `set` to help find the unique constellations in the dataset. A `set` is a data structure that automatically removes duplicates, so it could be useful for counting how many distinct constellations there are. Most astronomers don't often use `set` as a data structure, but it's a very useful way to quickly get unique elements in a list or array! \n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel comfortable, try using a `set` to collect the constellations and a `dict` (dictionary) to count the number of objects in each one (recall exercise 1 problem 3 for counting in loops). Remember, if you're unsure about how to create or use a set, think about how a list worksâ€”sets work similarly but don't allow duplicate values!\n",
