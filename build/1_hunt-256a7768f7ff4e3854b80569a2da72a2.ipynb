    "Welcome to the Unix Scavenger Hunt! This activity is designed to help you explore and become more comfortable with Unix commands. Each prompt is a mini adventure where you'll use the terminal to accomplish specific tasks. Feel free to try the challenge in any order!\n",

    "## Rules\n",
    "- You can use Google and other resources to find the commands and solutions, but try using `man` and `-h` first to see if the documentation makes sense!\n",
    "- Make sure to write down/document the commands you use and what those commands do. We will go around and share what we learned at the end of the class time.\n",
    "- Try to stick to terminal - don't use your machine's GUI to get to the solutions!\n",
    "- Have fun and enjoy the exploration!"
