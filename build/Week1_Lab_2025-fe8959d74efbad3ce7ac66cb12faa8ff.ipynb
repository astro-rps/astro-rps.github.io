    "Stars, to zeroth order, can be considered spherically-symmetric blackbodies. Under those conditions, their luminosities can be computed via the Stefan-Boltzmann law,\n",
    "$$ L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R$ is the radius, $T$ is the effective temperature of the Star, and $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $\\sigma = 5.67 * 10^{-8} \\rm \\ W/m^{2}/K^{4}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of today's lab is to implement this in Python, i.e., write a code to calculate the Luminosity (L) of a star according to the formula described above. The rough steps are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new code file called \"SB.py\" using the Terminal. \n",
    "2. Within SB.py, define a unique variable for each of $\\pi$, $\\sigma$, $R$, and $T$. For now, assume $\\pi = 3.14$, $R = 7 * 10^8$ meters and $T = 5776$ K.  You can assume the units work out (and therefore you can ignore them in Python). \n",
    "3. Using basic mathematical operations, compute the value of $L$ according to the formula above using the variables you just defined. Store the result in a new variable. (Hint: powers in python are implemented via the ** operator, e.g., 6**2 = 36)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using f-strings, print the result in a sentence that looks like: \n",
    "**The Luminosity of a star with effective temperature [value of T] and radius [value of R] is [value of L].**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Test the script by running it from the terminal. Outside of Python, compare your luminosity value to the Solar luminosity, $3.8 * 10^{26}$ Watts. Is your value greater, less than, or equal to the Solar luminosity?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Rather than simply hardcoding the value of $T$ and $R$ in your script, use the input() function to allow you to provide the values in the terminal at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Implement the comparison to the Solar Luminosity in your code and store the result a new boolean (True/False) variable called supersolar. Then extend your f-string above to print whether the star is more luminous than the Sun. The output should look like: **The Luminosity of a star with effective temperature [value of T] and radius [value of R] is [value of L]. It is [value of supersolar] that this is more luminous than the Sun.**\n",
