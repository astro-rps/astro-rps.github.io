    "\n",
    "Python can be installed in different ways on your computer. Usually, when we use python we also use external libraries. An external library is basically a collection of useful code written by someone else that you can acess without having to rewrite it yourself (you will learn more about these over the next few weeks). Python relies on package managers to install, update, and manage external libraries. The two primary package managers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pip**: The default Python package installer.\n",
    "  - Example: `pip install package_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conda**: A cross-language package manager that simplifies dependency management.\n",
    "  - Example: `conda install package_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how to use these package managers is essential for incorporating external libraries into your Python projects. You might also encounter **homebrew** or **MacPorts**. These are two other popular package managers, but they are not as common in astronomy. "

    "### What is a Virtual Environment? \n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment in Python is a self-contained directory that encapsulates a specific Python interpreter along with its associated libraries and scripts. It allows you to create isolated environments for different projects, each with its own set of dependencies, without affecting the system-wide Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Virtual Environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on multiple projects, each with its own set of dependencies, managing packages can become challenging. Virtual environments provide an isolated space for each project, allowing you to avoid conflicts between different project requirements. Code in pacakges and libraries can often change with new releases and versions, so it's important to work in environments to keep track of your Python version and the versions of the external packages you use. \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "It is always a good idea to create a *new* environment when you are starting a new research project, installing a particularly complex code that has a lot of dependencies, or developing your own piece of software.\n",

    "When do we install a package using `conda`, and when do we use `pip`? This is a bit messy, but in general, I suggest checking first if a conda version of the package is available. If it is, try installing via `conda` first. If not, or if that fails, then fall back on using `pip` (*Inside your environment of course!*). Using `pip` inside an environment will still mean you are only installing to that environment, but some of `conda`'s ways of measuring package dependencies and compatibility don't extend to things installed with `pip`. Generally, we create environments with the \"big things\" installed with conda (as above), then install smaller, or pip-only things, inside with pip.\n",
